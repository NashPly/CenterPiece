How to create new branch locally

- Make sure you are on the master branch:
git checkout master

- Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:
git pull origin master

- Create a new branch locally:
git checkout -b new-branch-name

- This command creates and switches to a new branch named new-branch-name. Replace new-branch-name with your desired branch name.
- Make your changes, stage, and commit them:
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

- Push the new branch to the remote repository on GitHub:
git push origin new-branch-name

- This command will push your new branch to GitHub. Replace new-branch-name with your actual branch name.
- Now, your new branch is created locally, and a copy of it is available on GitHub. If you want others to collaborate on this branch, they can pull it and create a local copy using:
git fetch origin
git checkout -b new-branch-name origin/new-branch-name

- Remember to replace new-branch-name with your actual branch name.
